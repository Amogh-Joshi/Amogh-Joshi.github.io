									<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
									<p> I will stirve to be aware and accepting of life experiences unfolding for me. I will develop my mind to have focus, commitment and sheer will. </p>

								<p>I have explored diverse areas of study before committing to a doctoral program at Purdue Polytechnic School. 
									During my Bachelor's degree (Electrical Engineering), I developed a smart water-meter, capable of transmitting information so that the concerned authority could
									 know about leakages and water theft. The project contributed to the understanding that I can solve problems in my city (Vadodara), albeit in a small way. 
									 My first job at Infosys introduced me to a blended learning approach for learning programming languages. I learned two programming languages (Python and Java) in four 
									 months. Although motivation and hard work played a role, I was amazed to see the design of instruction delivery and the learning management platform, enabling me to
									  learn quickly and be a 'High-Performer' at Infosys. This gave me clarity on another aspect of technology: used to improve learning. 
									  I wanted to explore the use of technology to make people's lives better, and so I decided to pursue a master's course that would facilitate this interest. In my current master's program, my focus is to use technology to enable learning and investigate the changes it brings about in the human brain. As a part of the coursework, we visited low-income colony to understand their problems and help community members have a say in future development, which would be undertaken by the government. In my doctoral program, I am continuing to explore how technology shapes the future of work and education. 

									
									</p>
								<p>My experiences have taught me to see different perspectives. The diverse education areas and work experiences have helped me to put on many "hats"
									when I try to solve a problem. In performing different roles, I have interacted with diverse people and worked with them successfully to complete a project or 
									to meet a deadline. This was only possible due to my ability to see different viewpoints and ways of thinking.</p>
